# NetworkingCode
Shifted this from my account to the Teams account. 
This should make it easier to find and deal with.
The final goal of this code is to communicate with the Doors server and ask for a passcode. 
It will then take this passcode and return it to the door, therefore opening the door for us. 
The door is the first of our hurdles in the course and therefore its good that we can get this done and out of the way early.
